A flight simulator desktop application that interacts with a dedicated server. We built our multithread application using C# and WPF with the MVVM software architectural pattern. The program features a convenient user interface for operating a small aircraft. The GUI contains four main components: A map components, a dashboard, a joystick and a connection section
Several search algorithms implementations, allowing comparison when, given a 'shortest-path' type problem, chooses the optimal algorithm and implements it as the solution method.
